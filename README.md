<b>Title</b>: A nonlinear observability analysis of ambient wind estimation with uncalibrated sensors, inspired by insect neural encoding

<b>Abstract</b>: Estimating the direction of ambient fluid flow is key for many flying or swimming animals and robots, but can only be accomplished through indirect measurements and active control. Recent work with tethered flying insects indicates that their sensory representation of orientation, apparent flow, movement, and control is represented by a 2-dimensional angular encoding in the central brain. This representation simplifies sensory integration by projecting the direction (but not scale) of measurements with different units onto a universal polar coordinate frame. To align these angular measurements with one another and the motor system does, however, require a calibration of angular gain and offset for each sensor. This calibration could drift with time due to changes in the environment or physical structure. The circumstances under which small robots and animals with angular sensors and drifting calibrations could self-calibrate and estimate the direction of ambient fluid flow while moving remains an open question. To address this, I present a methodical nonlinear observability analysis. My results show that it is mathematically feasible to continuously estimate flow direction and perform regular self-calibrations by adopting frequent changes in heading and orientation, and requires integration and temporal differentiation of three sensory measurements (orientation, apparent flow, heading). These conclusions are consistent with the zigzagging trajectories exhibited by many plume tracking organisms, suggesting that perhaps flow estimation is a secondary driver of their trajectory structure.
